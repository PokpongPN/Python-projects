# Python-projects

This repository demonstrates proficiency in Python programming foundations like variables, data structures, control flow, functions, OOP, and more through projects including chatbots, games, and other applications. It also highlights Python data projects spanning data cleaning, EDA, visualization, machine learning, and more. It reflects abilities in Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and other libraries for data manipulation and modeling with Python. The Python code, analysis, and visualizations presented exhibit core data science skills and proficiency in utilizing Python for advanced analytics.

Some projects are based on or inspired by online courses, notebooks, and tutorials which were valuable learning resources. However, recreating similar projects was for practicing skills only and does not imply copied content. Beyond any referenced sources, the code, analysis, and visualizations are my own work exhibiting Python abilities.
